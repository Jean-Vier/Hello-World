# Hello-World
This repository will be dedicated to creating something from scratch.
How is it going world? My name is Jean-luc I was named after Jean-Luc Picard who was the Next Generation captain on Star Trek. Shortly after entering Highschool I found myself meeting others who had a particular spark to their name and with this being said I was happily catapulted into the group of creative minds. It led me to creating music for the past 7 years. Now I've found a Very big interest into programming and being the back-end of a product. I hope to conversate with fellow programmers and gain knowledge in my desired path of a Full Stack developer.
Well that's a bit about me, everyone have a great day and I hope we talk soon.
